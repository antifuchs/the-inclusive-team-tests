# The Disadvantagement Test

The Disadvantagement Test is a test which can be used to determine the level of disadvantagement that a particular group might face within a certain working environment. This test was heavily influenced by [The Joel Test](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html).

## The Joel Test
Have you heard of [The Joel Test](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html)? Go ahead and follow that link and read the article if you haven't. This can wait til you get back. 

In case you haven't read it or don't go read it right now, here is the intro (from the linked article by [Joel Spolsky](http://joelonsoftware.com)):

> I've come up with my own, highly irresponsible, sloppy test to rate the quality of a software team. The great part about it is that it takes about 3 minutes. With all the time you save, you can go to medical school.

>
>* Do you use source control?
>* Can you make a build in one step?
>* Do you make daily builds?
>* Do you have a bug database?
>* Do you fix bugs before writing new code?
>* Do you have an up-to-date schedule?
>* Do you have a spec?
>* Do programmers have quiet working conditions?
>* Do you use the best tools money can buy?
>* Do you have testers?
>* Do new candidates write code during their interview?
>* Do you do hallway usability testing?

>The neat thing about The Joel Test is that it's easy to get a quick yes or no to each question. You don't have to figure out lines-of-code-per-day or average-bugs-per-inflection-point. Give your team 1 point for each "yes" answer. The bummer about The Joel Test is that you really shouldn't use it to make sure that your nuclear power plant software is safe.

>A score of 12 is perfect, 11 is tolerable, but 10 or lower and you've got serious problems. The truth is that most software organizations are running with a score of 2 or 3, and they need serious help, because companies like Microsoft run at 12 full-time. 
>
>Of course, these are not the only factors that determine success or failure: in particular, if you have a great software team working on a product that nobody wants, well, people aren't going to want it. And it's possible to imagine a team of "gunslingers" that doesn't do any of this stuff that still manages to produce incredible software that changes the world. But, all else being equal, if you get these 12 things right, you'll have a disciplined team that can consistently deliver.


This is a wonderful concept and itm has become a widely accepted metric for the software industry. A number of companies now advertise their "Joel Test Score" during recruitment and many of the topics that the test covers are discussed on a regular basis. 

The Joel Test has definitely raised the bar of expectations. Though it's an imperfect and sloppy test, it has been effective in improving the overall quality of companies by stating in simple terms the expectations and values that make a great software team. 

## Measuring Disadvantagement

The world needs The Joel Test for others topics as well. Specifically -- measuring disadvantagement. 

Disadvantagement here means measuring wether or not a company has has a level playing field vs creating an environment that advantages certain groups of people over other people. 


By stating this in general terms it allows the test to apply to a lot of disadvantagement situations rather than just focusing on a particular demographic in a particular kind of environment.

## Women In Technology 

A concrete use case is always a good starting point though. So, to make it easy, let's pick a group and environment and roll with that. One of the more glaring issues that any developer will be familiar with: women in technology. 

Women are a disadvantaged group in the technology industry. The don't get hired as often, they don't get equivalent salaries, they get subtly (and sometimes not so subtly) discriminated against and mistreated when they do have jobs. There's a lot of things to talk about here and there's a million reasons why but for now we don't care about those reasons or describing the problem in too much details. We just want to do a quick and dirty measurement to see if a technology company does not disadvantage women. 

Here's an example test:

### The Disadvantagement Test: Women in Technology

1. Does the ratio of women to non-women on your team mirror the ratio of women to non-women in your local census polls?
2. Is the average tenure of women on your team similar to the average tenure of non-women? 
3. Is the average salary for women on your team similar to the average salary of non-women?
4. Do women on your team write code? 
5. Do women on your team make important business decisions without requiring approval from non-women?
6. Does the marketing content for your company's products/brands portray women in the same way it portrays non-women?
7. Does casual office and lunch-time conversation ever point out the differences between women and non-women?
8. Does your team take special notice when a woman behaves in a way that is associated with a woman's traditional gender role?
9. Are public team discussions about disadvantagement issues encouraged and well received, and are those issues acted upon afterwards?
10. When a woman requests consideration for a personal matter which is unique to women, are those requests honored with the same consideration that a request about a personal matter which is more commonly shared by both women and non-women would be considered?


As you can see, in this test, one could easily replace "woman" and "women" with any potentially disadvantaged group, like say "homosexuals", "Muslims", "midgets" or "redheads".

## Usage

The goal is for no group to be disadvantaged, so to address that we can start by applying some basic metrics. If your company scores 10/10 or even 9/10 on this test, high fives. That's awesome and rare (though it should be the standard). If your company scored 8/10 or less on the above test (for any group, women or otherwise) then there are *serious* problems which should be a red flag to anyone who is a member of a disadvantaged group who is considering working for your copmany.

Hopefully they come to the interview armed with this test.
